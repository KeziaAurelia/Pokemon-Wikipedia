					<p>Pokémon<sup><a href="#R">[a][b]</a></sup> is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video
						games,
						animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media.
						The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist
						with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers.
						The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12,<sup><a href="#R">[2]</a></sup>
						but it is known to attract people of all ages.<sup><a href="#R">[I]</a></sup></p>

					<br>
					<p>The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak,
						from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on
						February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series,
						a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was
						exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon
						dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture
						in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016,
						the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality
						game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing
						media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.</p>

					<br>
					<p>Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure.<sup><a href="#R">[11]</a></sup> Unlike most IPs,
						which are owned by one company,
						Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.<sup><a
								href="#R">[1]</a></sup> Game Freak develops
						the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their
						consoles,
						while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing
						spin-off titles.
						The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property
						within Asia.
						The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009,
						The Pokémon Company International (TPCi),
						a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.<sup><a

			<h2 id="N">Name</h2>
			<p>The original full name of the franchise is <b>Pocket Monsters</b> (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā),
				which has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン) since its launch. When the franchise
				was released internationally, the short form of the title was used with an acute accent (´)
				over the e to aid in pronunciation.[14]</p>

			<p>Pokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe.
				As a noun, it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species
				name;<sup>[15]</sup>
				it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu"
				and "many Pikachu".<sup><a href="#R">[16]</a></sup></p>

			<br>
			<h2 id="GC">General Concept</h2>
			<p>The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon.
				Pokémon Red and Blue contain 151 Pokémon species, with new ones being added in subsequent games;
				as of January 2024, 1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced.<sup><a href="#R">[c]</a></sup> Most
				Pokémon are inspired by
				real-world animals or mythical creatures based on real-life folklore.[17] For example, Pikachu
				are a yellow mouse-like species<sup><a href="#R">[18]</a></sup> with lightning bolt-shaped tails[19]
				that possess electrical
				abilities.[20]</p>

			<p>The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has three primary goals:
				travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete
				their Pokédex; and train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in battles.
				Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon
				is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then
				transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. Once the catch is successful,
				the Pokémon is tamed and is under the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again,
				the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's Pokémon can engage in battles against
				opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed
				at children, these battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.<sup><a
						href="#R">[II]</a></sup>
				Pokémon never die in battle – they faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Poké
				Center.[III]</p>

			<p>When a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points.[29]
				After gaining a certain amount of it, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise.
				As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle.[30][31]
				Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called Pokémon evolution,
				and transform into stronger forms.[32] Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve
				through different means, such as exposure to a certain item.[33]</p>

			<h2 id="H">History</h2>

			<br>
			<h3>Origins</h3>
			<p>The main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri was born on August 28,
				1965,[34] and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo.[35] As a child, he enjoyed discovering
				and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded
				his town.[36][37] During Japan's economic miracle, many cities, including Machida,
				were significantly expanded. As a result, its nature was largely destroyed. In his second year
				of junior high school,[38][39] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing him
				to video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology [ja],
				Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. The title was inspired by
				the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.[40] He self-published
				the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[41][42] At the time,
				magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to
				fill a gap in the market.[43][44] Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist
				Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[45] Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,[41]
				by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game
				industry.[46]</p>

			<p>Tajiri's knowledge of video games brought him into contact with Tsunekazu Ishihara.
				Ishihara had studied Arts and Science at Tsukuba University, and was trained in CGI. After
				working in advertising for two years, Ishihara joined a company named Sedic in 1983, which
				created video graphics and software,[47] including one video game, Otocky (1987).[48][49]
				As video games grew in popularity, Sedic also produced a number of game-related television
				shows for Fuji Television's late-night slot.[47] In his job as a TV producer, Ishihara befriended
				Tajiri,
				as well as Shigesato Itoi, who would later become CEO of Ape, Inc.[50][51] Ishihara was also the general
				director of the world's first gaming encyclopedia: TV Games: Encyclopedia of Video Games (テレビゲーム―電視遊戯大全,
				Terebigēmu ― Denshi Yūgi Taizen).[52][53] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) wrote that, at the time,
				Ishihara was probably the most well-connected man in the industry,[54] with a knowledge of games
				"beyond comparison".[55] Ishihara was also interested in playing cards,[56][57] and contributed to the
				development of at least three simple card games designed by Itoi and published by Ape.[d]</p>

			<p>In 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a few other enthusiasts started an informal development
				team called Game Freak, named after the magazine it grew out of. Over the next few years,
				they independently developed the puzzle game Quinty, working on it alongside school or their
				regular jobs.[64] However, no one within the group knew how to make the game's music.
				After consulting all his contacts, Tajiri got in touch with Junichi Masuda, who became the group's
				composer.[65] Quinty was finished in 1989, and published by Namco.[66] Tajiri officially incorporated
				Game Freak Co., Ltd. on April 26, 1989.[67]</p>

			<br>
			<h3>1989–1995: Development of Red & Green</h3>
			<p>Tajiri started to think of what was to become Pokémon while completing Quinty, and before he
				officially founded Game Freak. Around this time, Nintendo announced the upcoming release of the
				Game Boy, a handheld console that would revolutionize the gaming industry. Tajiri learned that
				the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding Game Link Cable, two Game Boys could
				be linked together.[68] Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident while playing Dragon Quest II
				(1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for the Famicom (NES). The game features randomly appearing items
				of varying rarity, including an extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat.[e] Tajiri did not encounter
				any, while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this experience,
				Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to
				another.[IV]
				He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something
				else.[73]
				Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri's idea
				would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood experiences,[74] and an attempt to
				"regain
				the world that he had lost".[75] He would later state that the game represents "the
				story of a boy's summer day".[76]</p>
